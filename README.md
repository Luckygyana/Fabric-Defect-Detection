# Fabric-Defect-Detection
Automatic product inspection is a major concern in the quality control of various industrial products. The textile industry is one of the biggest traditional industries where automated inspection systems play a critical role in reducing inspection time and increasing the production rate.During the process of knitting a textile fabric frame, several types of defects may occur. For instance, the yarn used can be cut then resulting in a gap in the frame, a stain of oil can be caused by the knitting device or a color difference can be marked during the cloth drying. Thus, manual defect detection done by experts becomes quickly an overwhelming and fastidious task.
Therefore, having efficient and automatic inspection systems at hand is a major requirement for improving reliability and speeding up the quality control which may increase productivity.
